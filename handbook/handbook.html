            <h1>Detailed information for the<br>2023 RBLR1000<br>Saturday 10th June 2023</h1>

            <p>This is a sponsored long distance motorcycle ride to raise money for the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.  The event has been running since 2009 and has always had well over 100 riders taking part every year.  You don't all ride together, you choose which route to ride and either ride on your own, or with friends.</p>

            <p>All routes start and finish in one central location near Leeds in Yorkshire on a Saturday near to the Summer Solstice, meaning that apart from a few hours the whole route can be ridden in daylight.  If you complete a 1000 mile route in less than 24 hours you'll automatically become a member of the Iron Butt Association. </p>

            <h2>Please read this document in full to make sure you understand the challenge of this event.</h2>

            <h3>Step 1 - Choose a route &amp; Sign up on-line</h3>

            <p>There are three main routes to ride which all start and finish at Squires Cafe Bar, B1222, Newthorpe, near Sherburn in Elmet, West Yorkshire, LS25 5LX. </p>

            <p>The main Northern and Southern routes are just over 1000 miles and can be ridden in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. There's also a shorter 500 mile route which also can be ridden in either direction too. This means you actually have six routes in total to choose from:  </p>
