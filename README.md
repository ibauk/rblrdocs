# Document generator for RBLR1000

I produce rider documentation for the RBLR1000 event run by IBAUK on behalf of the RBLR.

To do this I read a database of rider details held in ScoreMaster format and a series of templates for certificates, receipt logs, disclaimers, etc
customised by route. The routes are:- A-NC [2], B-NAC [1], C-SC [4], D-SAC [3], E-5C [6], F-5AC [7]. The numbers in brackets are the 'class' field
in the ScoreMaster db representing each route.
